Our team was always there for each other, brainstorming solutions and supporting one another through challenges.

It all began in high school with <b class=\"lang-tag\">VBA</b>, where I took my first plunge into the world of coding. College ushered me deeper into the coding realms, where I encountered <b class=\"lang-tag\">Assembler</b>, <b class=\"lang-tag\">Java</b>, and <b class=\"lang-tag\">COBOL</b>, alongside the foundational trio of <b class=\"lang-tag\">HTML</b>, <b class=\"lang-tag\">CSS</b>, and <b class=\"lang-tag\">JavaScript</b>, complemented by their backend companions <b class=\"lang-tag\">SQL</b> and <b class=\"lang-tag\">PHP</b>.",

This definitely wasn't Kansas anymore. I dipped my toes into <b class=\"lang-tag\">Python</b> and thanks to my then girlfriend I got to learn <b class=\"lang-tag\">C++</b>, <b class=\"lang-tag\">Spring</b> for Java and <b class=\"lang-tag\">Flask</b> for Python as well.",

Sadly, its demise came swiftly when the HDD on which it all ran locked up.",

While initially enamored by their convenience, I've since found myself gravitating towards their vanilla counterparts. There's a certain charm in crafting solutions from scratch, allowing for greater customization and control.
